"""
Please write a program for recording the amount of time the user has spent in front of a television, 
computer or mobile device screen over a specific period of time.

The program should work as follows:

Sample output
Filename: late_june.txt
Starting date: 24.6.2020
How many days: 5
Please type in screen time in minutes on each day (TV computer mobile):
Screen time 24.06.2020: 60 120 0
Screen time 25.06.2020: 0 0 0
Screen time 26.06.2020: 180 0 0
Screen time 27.06.2020: 25 240 15
Screen time 28.06.2020: 45 90 5
Data stored in file late_june.txt

The user will input each day on a separate line, and the entries will contain three numbers separated by spaces, representing minutes.

With the above input, the program should store the data in a file named late_june.txt. The contents should look like this:

Sample data
Time period: 24.06.2020-28.06.2020
Total minutes: 780
Average minutes: 156.0
24.06.2020: 60/120/0
25.06.2020: 0/0/0
26.06.2020: 180/0/0
27.06.2020: 25/240/15
28.06.2020:Â 45/90/5"""
